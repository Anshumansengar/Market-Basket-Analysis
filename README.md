# Market-Basket-Analysis
Using **Apriori Algorithm** and **Eclat Algorithm** to do Market Basket Analysis of Customers purchasing behaviours. It can predict what the customer is going to buy next by looking at the products he is buying.  

## What is it?   
Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.  
Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data, & are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules..

User Manual

Use the sidebar through the different tabs of the dashboard

Upload Tables - this tab is used to define the folder(directory) where all the data files are found. 
please choose the folder "instacart-market-basket-analysis".
Tables - this tab helps to take a glance at the data of each dataset.
Descriptive Data Analytics- this tab has four subtabs representing descriptive graphs of the dataset.
Prescriptive Data Analytics- this tab implements a Market Basket Analysis. 
The Apriori algorithm is made interactive as the user has controls to change the parameters of the algorithm. Also, the user can choose if he wants to do the Apriori per product, per Aisle, or per Department. The user will see the marketing insights, Association rule scatterplots, association rule graph and association rules.

Other Application Areas
Although Market Basket Analysis conjures up pictures of shopping carts and supermarket shoppers, it is important to realize that there are many other areas in which it can be applied. These include:

Analysis of credit card purchases. Analysis of telephone calling patterns. Identification of fraudulent medical insurance claims. (Consider cases where common rules are broken). Analysis of telecom service purchases. Note that despite the terminology, there is no requirement for all the items to be purchased at the same time. The algorithms can be adapted to look at a sequence of purchases (or events) spread out over time. A predictive market basket analysis can be used to identify sets of item purchases (or events) that generally occur in sequence â€” something of interest to direct marketers, criminologists and many others.
